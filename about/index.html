    <h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Kylie. You might also know me as ready_readette, or Bookcombe, although Bookcombe really isn't just me, it's you as well, and others who want to find and share more than what we find on the nearest Barnes &amp; Noble table or Amazon bestseller list.</p>
<p>This is my personal reading/bookish/language-nerd blog though, so here are the relevent pieces of information about myself:</p>
<p>I speak English with a weird accent. People kindly write this off as me being both British and American and my brain surely having mashed two styles of intonation together, but who knows.</p>
<p>I studied historical linguistics at the University of Georgia and still many years later love linguistics. I work (and love my career) as a backend web developer at a Norwegian startup making the best e-commerce system in the universe - a career that I think follows very well off of the field of linguistics as I'm literally studying and writing in a new (albeit, non-human) language each day. But language remains a life passion, especially Polish, since I spent a formative secondary school year living there as an exchange student. I am especially interested in reading more Polish literature, and the translator Jennifer Croft is tied with Polly Barton as my career role model. I'm the kind of person who has career role models.</p>
<p>I currently live in California after previously having been located in Bath, England. That city spoiled me so much as a reader and book lover, and I want to bring that unabashed booklover spirit to the US.</p>
