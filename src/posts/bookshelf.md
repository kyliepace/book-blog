I moved back to the US 10 months ago, and back to my little house in California 5 months ago. For all of that time, I have had most of my books sat on the floor because I am both so picky about furniture, and also so reluctant to buy furniture new.

Does anyone else have that problem?

Well, I finally did the evil thing and bought the amazon dupe of what I really wanted and despite several finger hooverings over the "cancel order" button, this 6-shelf unit showed up today.
