Jia Tolentino is almost exactly my age. I like to think we share many childhood influences - the Southern suburbs, a history of cheerleading, Peace Corps, a participation in but skepticism of beauty aspirations, a move to New York City, millenial pop. Of course, Jia Tolentino is a far more interesting and brilliant millenial. I hold her up as an example of success, someone for me to aspire to be like, or conversly, to notice all the ways in which I have failed.

Fortunately, my model of success has thoughts on the way that we, especially women, especially millenial women who grew up coding html Angelfire sites and coveting denim miniskirts, imagine success and why it has a look. In the essay Always Be Optimizing, she writes of media examples of the ideal woman:
> There is an exaggerated binary fatalism to these stories, in which women are either successes or failures, always one fo the other - and a sense of inescapability that rings more true to life. If you can't escape the market, why stop working on its terms?

To be clear, I don't beat myself up because Jia Tolentino is beautiful and I'm not. I beat myself up because there are so many opportunities to have failed. On a low day, I want to become that ideal woman she describes - "beautiful, happy, carefree, and perfectly competent." On a good day, I remember her point "to look any particular way and to actually *be* that way are two separate concepts, and striving to look carefree and happy can interfere with  your ability to feel so."


> Women are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy - two systems that, at their extremes, ensure that individual success comes at the expense of collective morality. And yet there is enormous pleasure in individual success.

This is a phenomenon I see a lot at really probably every gym I've ever been to, even the progressive ones. People, especially women, completely supportive of other people's bodies, shyly admitting that while of course a thinner or ripped body is not a *better* body, not by their values, in fact they would actually like to please look shredded for an upcoming event. I count myself in this. Without wanting to shame women for their wants, because enough of that, I have to recognize the mindfuck at play. If we're turning to our appearance to send the message of our success (or at least how much better I am than all the other women at my high school reunion - fuck you, girl whose name I don't even remember) then how much have we really let go of damaging beauty standards?

That we really should investigate the forces at play behind our desires, as unpopular as that has become in contemporary mainstream feminism, is also supported by Amia Srinivasan in last year's [The Right to Sex](https://bookshop.org/books/the-right-to-sex-feminism-in-the-twenty-first-century/9780374248529).


The thread connecting each essay in this collection is the internet, but it's also just being a person, especially a woman, in the age we live.

I said that I felt Jia and I have a lot in common, including both being in the Peace Corps. This experience appears in more detail towards the end of the essay *We come from Old Virginia*, and for me emitted a flurry of highlighting and mental high fiving Jia. Because I, too, left the Peace Corps one year early and I, too, completely lost my mind being harassed constantly and the conflict of being "supposed to...adhere to other people's norms."

> I had it so easy compared to every local woman I knew. But even the suggestion that I was making something out of nothing made me wonder if I was, in fact, making something out of nothing. I started *wanting* things to happen to me, as if to prove to myself that I wasn't crazy, wasn't hallucinating. Spiky with resentment, I glared at men who looked at me too closely, daring them to give me another even to write down in my little secret file of incidents, daring them to make visible the dawning sense I had of women living in a continual state of violation, daring them to help me realize that I wasn't making any of this up.

I had that secret file, too Jia!! Yes, I UNDERSTAND YOU!!

And that would be enough for a popular feminist culture it-book of the summer. But Jia is doing more here than providing trendy blog posts, she's asking us to think better. I think this collection is closer in spirit to the aforementioned The Right to Sex than to, say, Shrill. It self-critically probes apart the reductivist assumptions implicit in let's call it instagram feminism, to name the app that I deleted after reading Trick Mirror. And for that attention to nuance, I truly admire Jia Tolentino.

<!-- I can't communicate how it moved me to finally confirm that yes, this confusion, this experience was real. Jia connects it to the larger frustrations of trying to content with sexual assualt, culturally, but let me tell you just that after I read this piece, I deleted Instagram from my phone.  -->
